# SUDOKU GAME.


## Description:
Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. 
In classic Sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, 
and each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") 
contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which 
for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.
